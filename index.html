                <p>My name is Anand Chaudhary. I was born in Nepal in the year 1990. I Went to South India for my higher
                    education when I was 11 back in the year 2001. I moved to the United States when I was 19 years of
                    age,
                    in
                    the year 2010. I was still pursuing my bachelors degree when I got the opportunity to come to the
                    US. I
                    decided to complete my degree and I did so in the year 2012 and secured my Bachelors of Business
                    Administration from the prestigious 178 years old college with rich curriculum, culture and
                    diversity
                    called
                    the Madras Christian College. </p>
                <p>One thing I really love about myself is my passion for learning new things. I think without this
                    curiosity I
                    would just be an empty shell of a person, just hollow on the inside. I have never stopped learning
                    and
                    will
                    continue to do so till the end of my life. I love to play music, dance and sing, cook delicious
                    food,
                    being
                    on my laptop, outdoor sports, travelling, photography, creating arts and be in the midst of nature
                    whenever
                    time permits.
                </p>
                <p>In my professional life I have worn several hats from being a school teacher to a sales person, a
                    young
                    businessman to a sales support specialist in an optical cabling manufacturing facility and even
                    working
                    as a
                    Production Supervisor at Samsung. For the past couple of years, I have completely invested and
                    dedicated
                    my
                    time
                    in the world of Information Technology learning programming languages and technologies. I’ve also
                    been
                    steadily
                    and actively progressing into the world of computer science and I absolutely love it. I started
                    coding
                    in
                    the
                    early 2017 and started with the Business Analyst training by developing my understanding of SDLC of
                    a
                    software
                    and the processes involved in it right from the project initiation to the deployment phase as well
                    as
                    various
                    methodologies involved in the different stages of the product life cycle. Right now, I’m undertaking
                    the
                    full-stack web-development course from the School of Professional Studies at Northwestern University
                    and
                    will be
                    graduating in November of 2019.
